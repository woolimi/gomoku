# Game Settings

<img src="/images/settings.png" class="border-2 border-black rounded-lg" />

Here is a list of available settings:

Note: When `AI Model` is set to `alphazero`, only **First Move** is editable. Other rule settings are locked to defaults (`Enable Double-Three Prohibition: on`, `Enable Capture: on`, `Capture Goal: 5`, `Player 1/2 Advantage: 0`).

- **AI Model**: Choose the AI backend used in Player vs AI mode (and for move evaluation requests).
- **Difficulty**: Select a difficulty level — easy, medium, or hard. (Note: `alphazero` has no difficulty settings.)
- **First Move**: Decide who makes the first move.
- **Enable Double-Three Prohibition**: Toggle Double-Three Prohibition on or off. (In `alphazero` mode, this is fixed to enabled.)
- **Enable Capture**: Toggle the capture rule on or off.
- **Capture Goal**: Set the number of captured pairs required to win the game.
- **Player 1 Advantage** / **Player 2 Advantage**: Set the number of captured pairs each player starts with.
