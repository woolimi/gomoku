# Game Settings

<img src="/images/settings.png" class="border-2 border-black rounded-lg" />

Here is a list of available settings:

Note: When `AI Model` is set to `alphazero`, only **First Move** is editable. Other rule settings are locked to defaults (`Enable Double-Three Prohibition: on`, `Enable Capture: on`, `Total of captured pair stones: 5`, `Player 1/2 Advantage: 0`).

- **AI Model**: Choose the AI backend used in Player vs AI mode (and for move evaluation requests).
- **Difficulty**: Select a difficulty level for `minimax`. `easy` is the weakest (shallower search), `medium` is stronger (time-bounded iterative deepening), and `hard` is the strongest (deep search with the hard evaluator). (`alphazero` has no difficulty setting.)
- **First Move**: Assign which side is **Black** (first move). In this project, `X` is Black and `O` is White. In the board UI, `X` is rendered as a dark stone and `O` as a light stone.
- **Enable Double-Three Prohibition**: Toggle Double-Three Prohibition on or off. (In `alphazero` mode, this is fixed to enabled.)
- **Enable Capture**: Toggle the capture rule on or off.
- **Total of captured pair stones**: Set the number of captured pairs required to win by capture. Valid range: **3 to 7** (default: **5**).
- **Player 1 Advantage** / **Player 2 Advantage**: Set the number of captured pairs each player starts with.
