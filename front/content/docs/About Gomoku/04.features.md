# Features

1. **History Mode**
   Navigate through previous moves without affecting the current game state. This feature allows you to review the entire match and analyze past decisions freely.

2. **Undo Turn / Undo Move**
   Use the undo button to revert recent actions. In **Player vs AI** mode, this appears as **Undo a turn** and rewinds both your last move and the AI reply together. In **Player vs Player (PvP)** mode, it appears as **Undo a move** and rewinds only the most recent move.
