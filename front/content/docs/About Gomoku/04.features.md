# Features

1. **History Mode**
   Navigate through previous moves without affecting the current game state. This feature allows you to review the entire match and analyze past decisions freely.

2. **Undo Turn / Undo Move**
   Use the undo button to revert recent actions. In **Player vs AI** mode, this appears as **Undo a turn** and rewinds both your last move and the AI reply together. In **Player vs Player (PvP)** mode, it appears as **Undo a move** and rewinds only the most recent move.

3. **Evaluation Tool** *(minimax mode only)*
   Right-click a board intersection to evaluate that position. (Desktop only; not available on touch/mobile.) The minimax engine analyzes the position and shows which player would benefit more based on the current game state.

   In `alphazero` mode, right-click evaluation is disabled. AlphaZero's evaluation uses a single neural-network forward pass (the value head), which is far shallower than the full MCTS search the AI uses to select its move. In testing, this made the evaluation suggestions misleading — the AI's optimal response consistently neutralized any advantage the evaluation predicted.

4. **Export / Import Options**
   You can export the current game state as a shareable URL or download it as a JSON file. Opening an exported URL automatically imports and restores the game state. This is useful for saving matches, sharing with others, or debugging.
