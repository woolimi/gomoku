# Intro

This **Gomoku** project was developed as part of an AI assignment at École 42, with contributions from [Sungyong Cho](https://sungyongcho.com) and [Woolim Park](https://woolimi.github.io). The AI components include a Minimax algorithm implemented in C++ and an AlphaZero model developed in Python. The Minimax engine was built for the original assignment, while the AlphaZero implementation was added afterward as a post-assignment extension. The frontend is built with Nuxt.js.

Gomoku is a classic board game where two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones on a board. The goal is to be the first to form an unbroken line of five or more stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In traditional Gomoku, it has been mathematically proven that the first player (Black) has a guaranteed winning strategy. As a result, official rules often restrict Black from making certain moves, such as the "double three," to balance the game. However, this version of the game is based on the specifications of the École 42 assignment, where both Black and White are subject to **Double-Three Prohibition** by default, along with an additional **capture rule**.

Because of this, the rules in our game may differ slightly from standard Gomoku. Detailed explanations of the rules can be found in the [Basic Rules](/docs/about-gomoku/basic-rules) and [Optional Rules](/docs/about-gomoku/optional-rules) sections.

Our Gomoku includes two play modes: **Player vs AI** (against Minimax or AlphaZero) and **Player vs Player (PvP)** for local competitive play between two human players.

In addition, we have implemented several advanced features to enhance gameplay. These include a **History Mode** for reviewing previous moves, **Undo Turn / Undo Move**, **URL import/export** and **JSON export** capabilities for sharing or restoring game states, and an **Evaluation System** that analyzes and scores the current move. These features are explained in more detail in the [Features](/docs/about-gomoku/features) section.

Enjoy the game!
