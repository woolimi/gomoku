# Optional Rules

In this game, you can enable or disable rules to customize your Gomoku experience.

## 1. Capture

When the `Capture` Rule is active, the following settings are available:

- `Goal`: The number of captured pairs required to win by capture. Valid values are **3 to 7** pairs (default: **5**).

- `Advantage`: Starting captured-pair count for each player.

- `Advantage` is limited by `Goal`: each player's advantage can be set from **0 to Goal - 1**.

- Example: if `Goal` is 5 and a player starts at `Advantage` 4, that player wins by capture after one additional pair.

## 2. Double-Three Prohibition

- If enabled: The game enforces Double-Three Prohibition and prevents moves that would result in a double-three situation.
- If disabled: Players are allowed to play double-threes, which can lead to more aggressive tactics and quicker victories.

## 3. Rule Interactions

- If `Capture` is disabled, capture wins are disabled and capture-related settings (`Goal`, `Advantage`) no longer affect the result.
- If both `Capture` and `Double-Three Prohibition` are disabled, the game effectively becomes free-style five-in-a-row (no restrictions, five-or-more wins).
- If `Capture` is disabled, five-or-more contiguous stones wins immediately; breakability-by-capture is not checked.
- If `Capture` is enabled, five-or-more contiguous stones is only a win when the line cannot be immediately broken by capture.
- If both `Capture` and `Double-Three Prohibition` are enabled, a move that creates a double-three remains forbidden even if that move would also capture stones.
