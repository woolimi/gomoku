# Basic Rules

The following are the fundamental rules of our Gomoku implementation:

- **Black plays first**, and players alternate turns.
- In the interface, **Black** stones are shown as `X` (dark stones), and **White** stones are shown as `O` (light stones).
- A capture occurs only when the **newly placed stone** completes a straight-line pattern of **player-opponent-opponent-player** along any of the four axes (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The two opponent stones are then removed.

	<img src="/images/capture-2.png" alt="after capture" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

- **Double-Three Prohibition**: A move is forbidden if it simultaneously creates **two open sequences of three stones** (known as "free-threes"), which would offer a guaranteed path to victory by alignment.

</div>

## Win Conditions

A player can win in one of the following ways:

- **By alignment**: A player who aligns **five or more consecutive stones** wins — **but only if** the opponent **cannot immediately break** the alignment by capturing part of it on the next move.

	<img src="/images/five-stone-breakable.png" alt="Continue game" class="sm:h-full" />
</div>

- **By capture**: In the default setting, a player who captures **5 pairs** wins.

## Draw Condition

- The game is a draw when the current player has no legal move left (for example, when the board is full, or when every empty point is forbidden by the double-three rule).

> Note: AlphaZero's terminal check currently treats any contiguous five-in-a-row as terminal and does not enforce breakability. See [Training Pipeline](/docs/alphazero/training-pipeline) for details.

Context note: in the basic rules of both Gomoku-family games and Go, Black plays first (for example, [RIF Renju rules](https://www.renju.net/rifrules/) and [American Go Association rules](https://www.usgo-archive.org/rules-of-go)). In this project, that convention is preserved: the side assigned to move first is treated as Black.
