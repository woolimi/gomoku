# Live Demo Deployment

This page describes the deployment setup behind the live demo at **[sungyongcho.com/gomoku](https://sungyongcho.com/gomoku)** (including this docs site).

## Infrastructure

| Service | GCP Machine | vCPU | RAM |
|---------|------------|------|-----|
| Minimax | `e2-small` | 0.5–2 | 2 GB |
| AlphaZero | `c2d-standard-4` | 4 | 16 GB |

Both backends run as Docker containers on GCP Container-Optimized OS VMs. A Cloudflare Worker handles path-based routing (`/minimax/*`, `/alphazero/*`) to the respective backends.

Response times on the live demo will vary from benchmark numbers cited in the documentation — the minimax engine in particular runs on a shared-core instance to keep hosting costs low.
